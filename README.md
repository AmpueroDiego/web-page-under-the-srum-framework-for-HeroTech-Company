### Intro
We are aware of the danger and disorder of the cities that exist when we hand over our electronic devices for repair at the downtown and leave them in inexperienced hands who damage the devices or change parts. So in a meeting with friends we said: why don't we create something different? a better opcion that has a better experience. Therefore, in August 2022 we decide to start a HeroTech project, an honest startup that seeks better aspects of the tehcnical services, or who knows, the world. 

HeroTech (fictitious company) is a innventive company focus in technical services of devices that involve a four extremely innovative concepts:
1. Tracking page: Helps customers track the status of their devices in real time at any time through the website.
2. Dark Store: Offer services or products exclusive for online shopping, with a phisical warehouse or workshop, but no open to the public.
3. Last mile on demand: Ecommerce revolution that provide the posibility when a customer places an order to be delivered a week later or asap.
4. Device repair recording: Allows customers to view the repair procedure of their devices in order to the safety and integrity of their devices.
